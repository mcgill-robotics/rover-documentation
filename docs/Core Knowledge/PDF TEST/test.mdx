# Embedded PDF Example

Below is an embedded PDF file that is hosted locally in the GitHub repository.

  <a href="/pdfs/Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit Carrier Board Specification.pdf">Download PDF</a>.

## Hosting the PDF in Docusaurus

To ensure the PDF is accessible, place it inside the `static` folder of your Docusaurus project:

```
my-docusaurus-project/
├── static/
│   ├── pdfs/
│   │   ├── example.pdf
```

Docusaurus automatically serves files from `static` at the root URL, so `/pdfs/example.pdf` will be accessible in your site.
