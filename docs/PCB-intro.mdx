# Introduction to Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs)

This is a template page about PCBs. Replace this content with your specific information.

## What is a PCB?

A Printed Circuit Board (PCB) is a board made of insulating material, typically fiberglass, with conductive pathways etched onto it. These pathways connect electronic components, allowing them to communicate and function as a circuit.

## Basic Structure

* **Substrate:** The base material, often FR-4 (a fiberglass epoxy laminate).
* **Copper Layers:** Thin layers of copper foil etched to create conductive traces.
* **Solder Mask:** A protective coating that prevents solder bridges.
* **Silkscreen:** A layer of ink used for component labeling and identification.

## Key Concepts

* **Traces:** Conductive pathways that connect components.
* **Vias:** Holes that connect different layers of the PCB.
* **Pads:** Exposed copper areas where components are soldered.
* **Through-hole vs. Surface Mount (SMT):** Two common methods for mounting components.
